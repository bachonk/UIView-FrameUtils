UIView-FrameUtils
=================

UIView category that provides convenience methods for setting and getting frame properties.

I know you've always wanted setters for frame properties such as height and width, and now they're available right from any `UIView` or `UIView` subclass! There are also helpful setters for view centers, as well as getters to avoid having ugly `CGRectGetMaxYBlahBlahBlah` in your code

### Installation

Just drag and drop the `UIView+FrameUtils.{h,m}` files into your project.

### Usage

Call any of the various getter and setter methods from any UIView instance or subclass.
